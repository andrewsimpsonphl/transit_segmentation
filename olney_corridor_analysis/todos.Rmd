# Doing

- Add filtering of patterns - need to QAQC
- Add charts that compare subcorridors
- Automate remaining text in document
- Add reliability charts to subcorridor documents - tried to add this through a for loop, works in Rmd but not knitted

# Next to-dos

- Convert other tables to reactables & try to add "export" option
- Add stop level charts 
- Add subcorridor ID to stops
- Clean up the corridor/subcorridor input process
- Standardize & functionalize chart formatting 
- Fully implement smarter stop ordering throughout code

# Roadmap

## Near term
- Create corridor level map for top of document
- Create app_v2 to allow user input
- Develop diagramatic view of data at stop/link level - showing lines between stops for speed/running time and points at stops for ons/offs and dwell

## Longer term
- integrate Swiftly AVL data into tool
- create output to "save" for future before/after analysis
- create output to take to predictive tool

# Done

- Create joyplot of runtimes
- Create functions to assist in filtering of route patterns
