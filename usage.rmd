```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr) ; library(tidyverse)
read_chunk("segmentation_code.R")

```

## Pull Data from ARCGIS Online

Running `pull_arcgis_dat()` will download the most recent shapefiles and assign `FINAL_ID` to each segment
```{r pull_data, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

gis_dat <- pull_arcgis_dat()

```

## Load data onto segments

Key thing to know:
links are from/to links taken from model 
segments are coded and joined links that are the transit corridor

``` {r load_data,  echo=FALSE}
segments_loaded <- load_segments(gis_dat)
stops <- read_stops()

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = segments_loaded, 
          aes(colour = log(load))) + 
  coord_sf()

```
